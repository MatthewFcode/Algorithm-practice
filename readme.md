## Algorithm Practice 

This is my repository for my algorithm practice using **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** to solve algorithms, and **Test Driven Development** with **Unit Testing** to test the algorithms I write 😊

Feel free to clone down this repository and write your own algorithms and tests alongside mine.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MatthewFcode/Algorithm-practice.git
   ```

2. **Move into the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd Algorithm-practice
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   _(The project uses Node.js to handle testing and TypeScript dependencies.)_

4. **Get stuck in!!! 🚀**
